## About the Project

This React Video Editor serves as a foundational tool for understanding and interacting with the core building blocks of Remotion. It offers a user-friendly, browser-based interface that allows users to compose videos by arranging clips and adding text overlays seamlessly. While the current version provides a smooth and interactive experience, it's designed to be a stepping stone toward building a fully-fledged video editor

Key features include:

- Arranging video clips on a timeline
- Adding static text overlays to videos
- Real-time preview of composition

While this open-source version provides basic video composition functionality, it does not include advanced editing features. For a more comprehensive video editing solution, check out the [pro version](https://www.reactvideoeditor.com/) which offers additional capabilities and integration options for React applications.

**Important Note:** This project uses the Remotion video player. If you intend to use this project, please be aware that you may need a Remotion license depending on your use case. Check out the [Remotion Licensing](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/licensing) page for more information and ensure you comply with their licensing terms.
